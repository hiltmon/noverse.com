Here are *some* of the engagements and projects in which Noverse has designed and developed the software. We have several more in the pipeline, and hope to reveal them soon.

## Kifu

Noverse is very proud of our [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) product. We set out to create a web-based product to help smaller non-profit organizations to manage their databases of people and events. We wanted a product that was affordable to them, easy and fun to use, yet rigorous in process and accuracy. And we succeeded. Find out more at [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com).

*Used: Ruby on Rails*

## Wikiposit

Noverse has developed the core server, pipeline and platform for the new Wikiposit, to be launched soon. The goal of Wikiposit is to be a searchable directory of all raw data on the Internet, and to deliver that data in a common format for use by its clients. As of writing, we have over 500,000 datasets in the beta version of the product.

*Used: Ruby on Rails, Redis, Sphinx*

## oo.com.au

<a href="http://www.oo.com.au">{% img left /images/oo.com.au-114.png 114 114 %}</a>

Noverse was engaged by [oo.com.au](http://www.oo.com.au/), Australia's largest online department store, to design and develop an iPhone app to enable their customers to browse and purchase their products. Noverse created a test server harness using Ruby on Rails, and then built the app using Objective-C and JSON. Once the server API was established, Noverse completed the app and managed the beta test process. Once [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) approval was complete, Noverse successfully submitted the app to the App Store. Throughout the whole process, Noverse LLC advised [oo.com.au](http://www.oo.com.au/) of all the steps being taken, the artwork and app store requirements and PayPal standards. The app is available [on the Australian and New Zealand app store](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/oo-com-au/id422693241?mt=8&ls=1) and has over 15,000 unique copies downloaded, returning a 5% increase in sales.

*Used: Objective-C on iOS, Ruby on Rails (server)*
